1. Car object in an Automobile application
Write a class named car with attributes (brand, model, year and speed). Have a default
constructor and also a parameterized constructor to initialize the object. Have following
two methods:
a. A method to display information about the car.
b. Accelerate() which will take incrementSpeed as parameter and increases the speed of
the car by incrementSpeed.
Instantiate couple of cars from this class and display its information before and after
speed increment.

class Car {
private String brand;
private String model;
private int year;
private int speed;
public Car() {
this.brand = "Unknown";
this.model = "Unknown";
this.year = 0;
this.speed = 0;
}
public Car(String brand, String model, int year, int speed) {
this.brand = brand;
this.model = model;
this.year = year;
this.speed = speed;
}
public void displayInfo() {
System.out.println("Car Information: Brand: " + brand + ",
Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year + ", Speed: " + speed + " km/h");
}

public void accelerate(int incrementSpeed) {
this.speed += incrementSpeed;
System.out.println("The car has been accelerated by " +
incrementSpeed + " km/h. New speed: " + speed + " km/h");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {

Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020, 60);
Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022, 80);

System.out.println("Before acceleration:");
car1.displayInfo();
car2.displayInfo();

car1.accelerate(20);
car2.accelerate(30);
System.out.println("\nAfter acceleration:");
car1.displayInfo();
car2.displayInfo();
}
}
